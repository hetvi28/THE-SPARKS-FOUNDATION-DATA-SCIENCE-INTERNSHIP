The project was inspired by the desire to understand the impact of study habits on academic performance.

# Requirements
1. Python 3.6+    
2. pandas
3. numpy
4. scikit-learn
5. matplotlib

# Data Preprocessing
Before training the model, the data is preprocessed to handle any missing values and to split it into training and testing sets.

Model Training
A Linear Regression model is trained on the training dataset.
â€‹
# Model Evaluation
The effectiveness of the trained model is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric, which measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted scores. A lower MSE indicates a better fit.

# Results

The Linear Regression model was trained and evaluated using the dataset. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) was calculated to assess the model's performance. The results, including the regression line and data points, were plotted to visualize the relationship between study hours and student performance.

# Conclusion

This project successfully modeled the relationship between study hours and student performance using a Linear Regression algorithm. The model's effectiveness was evaluated using Mean Squared Error, and the predictions provided valuable insights into expected student performance based on study hours.
